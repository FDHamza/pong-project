# pong-project
 # The rule-based AI in this Pong project adjusts its difficulty across four levels: Easy, Average, Hard, and Extreme. Each level controls how fast the AI paddle moves and how it reacts to the ball. As the difficulty increases, the AI becomes faster and more accurate, making it harder for the player to score. The AI is programmed to follow the ball's movement and position itself to block the player's shots
